# ghaiklor-os-rust

Simple operating system created in educational purposes.

The main goal I'm following is to learn how operating systems are working from the ground up.
Starting from the own boot sector, hardware and software interrupts, own drivers.

Repository is suffixed with rust because I have another one [simple OS written with C](https://github.com/ghaiklor/ghaiklor-os-gcc).
