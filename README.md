# ghaiklor-os-rust

This is not a **REAL** operation system.
It's just a simple operation system created in educational purposes.

The main goal I'm following is to learn how OS is working from the ground up.
Starting from the own boot sector, hardware and software interrupts, own drivers.

Repository is suffixed with rust because I have another one [simple OS written with C](https://github.com/ghaiklor/ghaiklor-os-gcc).
